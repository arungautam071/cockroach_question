3. Provide a program to calculate the time and distance based on 
below problem.
• We have a 100-meter rod.
• At both ends, 1-1 cockroach is place.
• The left cockroach moves at 1 meter per second forward, and every 10 seconds moves 2 
meters backward.
• The right cockroach moves at 2 meters per second forward, and every 5 seconds moves 1 
meter backward.
• When both cockroaches meet, we have to calculate the time and distance. Calculate the total
time to complete the 100 meter rod.
